# 2026-02-08 (Asia/Dhaka)

- Configured Brave Search API for agent web_search; key lives at `tools.web.search.apiKey` (not `web.braveApiKey`).
- Updated Spotify skill file multiple times:
  - Prefer `spotify` CLI first; use `TERM=dumb` to avoid tput/$TERM issues.
  - Added CLI capabilities and simplified fallback (AppleScript only if URI needed; browser last resort).
  - Later trimmed redundancy and re-added commented cheat-sheet.
- Whisper transcription: turbo model download was huge + checksum mismatch; used `--model small` successfully.
- Jira access confirmed via `jira-ai` org alias `portonics`; pulled assignee=currentUser() open issues list (17).
- Preference clarified: when user says “chats” it means Google Chat; use `gog` Chat tools for that.
- Gmail triage via `gog` used for project follow-ups; pulled CrossConnect release v1.0.10 email + Gemini meeting notes and generated Monday action points draft.
