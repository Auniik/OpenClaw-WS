# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

## Status/Standup/Follow-up trigger (IMPORTANT)
If Anik says any of these:
- `standup followup`
- `team status`
- `today standup`
- `tomorrow standup`
- `followups`
- `last day/weeks status and next followups`

Treat it as a full project follow-up / status command with these defaults:

1. **Time window:** Only Anik's work hours (**2:00 PM–11:00 PM, Asia/Dhaka**)
2. **Scope:** Only **WisdomWear-related** items
3. **Sources to check every time:**
   - Google Calendar (meetings)
   - Google Chat (WisdomWear spaces + relevant latest DMs, Map space, dm's display names from Contacts (profile/WORK.md))
   - Jira blockers, closest due date tasks of WisdomWear team
   - Meeting transcripts/notes (Gemini/Docs/linked notes)
   - Project-related email threads
4. **Output:** concise, actionable, with raised/asked by, responsible person, status and reference (link/id/source)

## Priority rules
- Prioritize **blockers, dependencies, deadlines, decisions needed**
- Skip noise/non-actionable updates
- If no meaningful updates: say so directly
